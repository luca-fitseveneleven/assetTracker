# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.13.1] - 2026-10-05

### Fixed

- **Microsoft sign-in users now appear in the app.** Users created by an OAuth
  sign-in had no organization, so every org-scoped page hid them. They are now
  assigned to `SSO_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID`, but only when `MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID`
  is pinned to a single tenant and the org has free user seats. Otherwise the
  sign-up is refused. Run `sql/upgrade/2026-10-05-sso-users-org-backfill.sql`
  once to fix users created before this release.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-10-04

### Changed

- **License changed from MIT to the Functional Source License 1.1, MIT Future
  License (FSL-1.1-MIT).** Self-hosting for your own organisation stays free
  with every feature. Offering Asset Tracker to others as a competing
  commercial product or hosted service is no longer permitted. Each release
  becomes MIT two years after it is published. v0.12.0 and earlier remain
  available under MIT. Marketing, docs, SEO and OpenAPI metadata now say
  "source-available" instead of "open source".

## [0.12.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added

- **Optional marketing/app domain split.** Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETING_URL` to
  serve the marketing site on its own host while the app stays on
  `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, from the same deployment. Cross-host requests are
  307-redirected, the app host root goes to login and is excluded from indexing,
  and canonicals, sitemap and OG metadata use the marketing origin. Session
  cookies stay on the app host. An invalid split config fails at startup. Unset
  (the default) changes nothing.

### Fixed

- `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` are served without authentication; crawlers
  were previously redirected to the login page.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-09-30

### Changed

- **Marketing site redesign.** Landing, pricing, terms and privacy use a new
  technical design (hairline grid, mono type, lime accent) in light and dark.
  Product visuals are coded mocks with consistent sample data; schematic feature
  cells and an ASCII illustration replace the icon cards. The invented usage
  statistics are removed, and every feature claim is backed by the codebase.
- Marketing pages live in a `(marketing)` route group with scoped `.mkt` theme
  tokens; the app's theme is unaffected. URLs are unchanged.
- The OG image matches the new look.
- README and docs link to the canonical repository `LucaGerlich/asset-tracker`.

### Fixed

- The theme no longer flashes on load: next-themes' pre-hydration script now
  receives the CSP nonce instead of being blocked.
- The OG image is served without authentication, so link previews work.
- The theme toggle button has an accessible name.
- Landing FAQ states the real Starter limits (100 assets, 3 users).
- Self-host commands on the marketing site select the `with-db` compose profile
  and run inside the cloned directory.
- Marketing pages: the skip link works, the sample table is keyboard-scrollable
  on narrow screens, and copied commands exclude the `$` prompt.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-09-08

### Changed

- **MFA enrolment now runs on BetterAuth's `twoFactor` plugin end to end.** The
  settings page enables, verifies, disables and regenerates backup codes through the
  plugin client, so the flag the login gate checks is finally the one enrolment
  writes. **Users who had MFA enabled must enrol again** (the previous flag was never
  enforced at login). LDAP/SSO accounts can enrol without a local password; backup
  codes are stored encrypted. Enrolment, removal, regeneration and TOTP/backup-code
  logins are written to the audit log; the credentials login audit no longer fires
  before the second factor is verified.
- Compliance dashboard: the "User Authentication Controls" check reports real
  two-factor coverage instead of "not yet implemented".

### Security

- Compliance dashboard counts (users, assets, audit logs) are scoped to the caller's
  organization; they were computed across all tenants.
- Vercel builds run `prisma migrate deploy` only when `VERCEL_ENV=production`.
  Preview builds used to migrate whatever database the Preview environment pointed
  at, which on the personal deployment was production.

### Removed

- Custom `/api/auth/mfa/{setup,verify,disable}` routes, `lib/mfa.ts`, the
  `otplib` dependency, the `user.mfaEnabled/mfaSecret/mfaBackupCodes` columns
  (migration `20260908_betterauth_two_factor`) and the unused `encryptArray` helpers.

## [0.9.6] - 2026-09-07

### Security

- Scope the unpaginated `GET /api/statusType` cache key by organization (one
  tenant's status names were served to every tenant for up to five minutes)

### Fixed

- DB-backed cache and lockout suites now pass in CI: keys are cleared before every
  test, TTL tests use a real 1-second TTL instead of fake timers (expiry is decided by
  Postgres `NOW()`), the lockout doubling check tolerates statement drift, and the
  env-validation test removes the CI-injected `DATABASE_URL` explicitly
- Fresh-database `prisma migrate deploy` verified locally and in CI (issue #86)

### Docs

- TECHNICAL_DEBT.md: every deferred item re-verified against the code; strict-mode,
  timestamp and loading.tsx figures corrected; item 29 raised to critical; items
  33–52 added (advertised-but-unfinished features, structural debt) plus a list of
  repository loose ends (issue #86 root cause, stale stash/branches/draft PRs)

## [0.9.5] - 2026-09-02

Release-readiness audit: seven review agents, seven fix agents, ~60 fixes.

### Security

- Organization-scope all 19 by-ID getters in the data layer (17 detail/edit pages
  were readable cross-tenant by UUID) and the EULA template getters/routes
- Close IDOR gaps: organizations/[id] GET (per-org isadmin bypass), asset attachment
  file route (failed open without org), dashboard widget PUT, advanced reports
- Verify OIDC ID token signatures against the IdP JWKS (jose); link accounts only on
  externalId or IdP-verified email
- HTML-escape email template variables; validate Freshdesk domain; encrypt and mask
  Slack/Teams webhook URLs; strip mfaSecret/mfaBackupCodes/ldapDN from user responses
- Cap procurement receivedQty and list limits; make setup guard atomic
- Refuse to boot production with missing or weak required env vars
- Update better-auth to 1.6.30 and all dependencies within their semver ranges
  (0 production advisories, was 1 critical / 53 high)
- Remove orphaned unauthenticated /api/auth/mfa/validate route

### Fixed

- Regenerate stale bun.lock (frozen install and every CI job were failing)
- Docker build: bun + bun.lock, node 22, no migrate in build stage, HEALTHCHECK,
  one-shot migrate compose service
- set-schema.mjs normalizes the schema name per file; committed migrations consistent
- Sentry tunnel /monitoring no longer redirected to /login; overdue-returns cron registered
- CI runs on the development branch; dead demo-reset workflow removed
- Type-check clean including test files; DB-gated suites run in CI with Postgres
- Client: TCO report / role removal / maintenance loads surface errors; accessible
  names on icon-only buttons and the photo lightbox

### Removed

- 14 never-imported components, db-resilience.ts, deleteUser(), tests/setup/prisma-mock.ts,
  the NextAuth-era deployment guide

### Docs

- Deployment guides corrected to BETTER_AUTH_* and the bun toolchain; CHANGELOG
  backfilled 0.5.0–0.9.4; .env.example documents every key the code reads;
  TECHNICAL_DEBT.md rewritten with open decisions (MFA, SSO, strict mode)

- **Self-service user role** — non-admin users see only their assigned assets/accessories/licences on list pages; Maintenance, Audits, Import hidden from non-admin nav
- **Programmable label templates** — `{{placeholder}}` syntax with `{{#if field}}...{{/if}}` conditionals, live preview in admin settings, backward compatible with old field-array templates
- **Serial number auto-detect** — identifies Apple/Dell/Lenovo from serial patterns, auto-selects manufacturer and category on asset create form
- **Event log with revert** — `createAuditLogWithSnapshot` stores before/after JSON diffs; revert API restores previous state; revert button in audit log viewer for UPDATE actions
- **Sub-locations** — hierarchical parent-child locations with expandable tree table, parent dropdown in create/edit forms

- **Umami analytics** — self-hosted tracking via `next/script` with `afterInteractive` strategy

### Changed

- **Notification dropdown — instant UI via `useOptimistic`** — mark-as-read, delete, mark-all-read, and delete-all now apply to the UI in the same frame the user clicks, instead of waiting for the server round-trip. Failed mutations auto-revert with a toast (rollback is automatic via React 19's `useOptimistic` when the surrounding transition ends without committing). Internally collapses the prior `notifications` + `unreadCount` `useState` pair into one source-of-truth `NotifState` driven by a typed reducer with four action variants, eliminating a class of dual-write desync bugs. "Mark all read" now fires one optimistic update + a single `Promise.allSettled` fan-out instead of N independent state updates that flickered the list. `unreadCount` is adjusted (not derived) because it represents the true server total, which can exceed the displayed limit of 10
- **Performance** — parallelized data fetching with `Promise.all()` on assets, asset detail, and user settings pages
- **Performance** — added 2-minute PostgreSQL cache to 10+ data functions (assets, accessories, consumables, licences, users, categories)
- **Performance** — reduced Sentry trace sampling from 100% to 10% in production
- **Performance** — optimized `pg.Pool` for serverless (max=3 connections, 10s idle timeout, 5s connection timeout, 30s statement timeout)
- **Performance** — deduplicated `orgWhere()` and `ensureCacheTable()` calls on cold starts
- **Performance** — dashboard `StatsWidget` now uses server-fetched counts instead of 3 full API calls
- **Database** — converted `rate_limits` table to UNLOGGED for reduced write overhead
- **Database** — schema-qualified all raw SQL table references (`"assettool"."cache"`, `"assettool"."rate_limits"`)
- **Database** — self-healing table creation if cache/rate_limits tables are missing
- **Accessories filter UI** — compact single-row layout replacing the multi-row filter design
- **Admin settings** — sidebar is now sticky with independent scroll
- **Compliance dashboard** — stub items show "Not Yet Available" instead of misleading "Needs Review"
- **CRON_SECRET** — now required in production (was optional)
- **Validation schemas** — consolidated `validation.ts` and `validations.ts` into single file with stricter schemas
- **API handler types** — added `NextRequest` type annotations to 64 handler functions across 31 files

### Fixed

- **Search injection** — replaced `to_tsquery` with `websearch_to_tsquery` in all 6 search routes
- **QR codes** — replaced hardcoded `192.168.0.81` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`
- **Date serialization** — cached dates (strings from JSONB) no longer crash `.toISOString()` calls
- **Referential integrity** — deleting a manufacturer/location/supplier/status/model referenced by assets returns 409 with count
- **Admin session staleness** — 3 admin settings routes now use `requireApiAdmin()` instead of cached cookie check
- **SCIM privilege escalation** — PATCH handler whitelist prevents setting `isadmin` via SCIM Operations
- **Import security** — CSV user import now generates random bcrypt password hash (was null)
- **Localhost fallbacks** — removed all `|| "http://localhost:3000"` patterns from SSO, invite, and magic link URLs
- **Dead code** — removed `/sentry-example-page`, unused `postData()` export, and `testData` import

### Security

- **Organization scoping** — added `scopeToOrganization` to all write endpoints (POST/PUT/PATCH) for assets, accessories, consumables
- **Ownership verification** — update/delete operations verify the record belongs to the caller's organization
- **Cross-tenant data leaks** — fixed advanced reports, stock alerts, checkout history, kits, components, licence seats, and organizations endpoints
- **Query limits** — added `take: 1000` to unbounded `findMany` in `getAsset` and `getUser` routes
- **DB_SCHEMA validation** — environment variable validated against `[a-zA-Z0-9_]` to prevent SQL injection
- **Webhook OPTIONS** — added authentication to previously unauthenticated endpoint
