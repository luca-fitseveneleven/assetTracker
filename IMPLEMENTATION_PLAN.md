# Release Readiness Implementation Plan

## Goal
Deliver a release-ready Asset Tracker that fully implements every item in `FEATURES.md`, with production-grade stability, security, documentation, and operations. Always document the implementation plan in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, in `CHANGELOG.md` and in `README.md`.

## Scope
All sections in `FEATURES.md`, including "In Progress", "Pending", and "Future Enhancements".

## Assumptions
- PostgreSQL + Prisma remain the system of record.
- Next.js App Router remains the primary UI framework.
- Feature flags remain available for gradual rollout.

## Phase 0: Baseline and Alignment
- Verify database migrations are fully applied.
- Validate `FEATURES.md` against codebase and adjust scope if needed.
- Confirm environment variables and secrets (auth, email providers, storage).
- Establish acceptance criteria and QA checklist per feature group.
- Decide rollout strategy for multi-tenancy, SSO, and compliance features.

## Phase 1: Finish Current In-Progress Features
- User history timeline on user detail page.
- Asset label printing workflow from assets table.
- Saved search filters UI (persist to DB).
- Maintenance scheduling UI (list/create/update/close).
- Warranty tracking UI on assets.
- Depreciation UI surfaced in asset views and reports.
- Custom fields on asset create/edit/detail.
- Consumable quantity/minimums UI with validation.

## Phase 2: Complete Pending Functionalities
- Asset photos/attachments UI and API integration.
- Consumables stock level management workflows.
- Automatic reorder alerts beyond low-stock notifications.
- Consumable check-out system and usage tracking.
- Persistant per-user settings
- Freshdesk integration settings

## Phase 3: Multi-Tenancy and RBAC
- Organization and department management UI.
- Role management UI and user-role assignment.
- Enforce org scoping for all queries and API endpoints.
- Admin tooling for org configuration and defaults.

## Phase 4: Integrations and API Surface
- OpenAPI docs UI backed by `public/openapi.json`.
- Webhooks UI and delivery log viewer.
- SSO/SAML provider integration and configuration UI.
- LDAP/AD integration (sync + auth mapping).
- Slack/Teams integrations for notifications.

## Phase 5: Advanced Asset Workflows
- Asset reservation/booking UI with approval flow.
- Asset lifecycle management workflow (procure → deploy → retire).
- Asset transfers between users/locations/orgs.
- Approval workflows for asset requests.
- Barcode scanning and labeling support.
- Location tracking integration scaffolding (GPS/RFID).
- Automated workflows engine (rules + triggers).
- AI-assisted support/helpdesk integration.

## Phase 6: Performance and Scalability
- Server-side pagination and filtering for large tables.
- Caching strategy (server-side + optional Redis).
- Query optimization and index reviews.
- Rate limiting and request throttling enforcement.
- Database transactions for multi-step operations.
- Server-side validation for critical APIs.

## Phase 7: Compliance and Security
- Encryption at rest and secrets management strategy.
- Enhanced audit logging (full entity diffs, admin actions).
- GDPR/data retention and export tooling.
- Compliance reporting scaffolding (SOX/HIPAA as needed).
- Security hardening beyond current feature flags.

## Phase 8: UX, Accessibility, and Documentation
- Skeleton loaders and perceived performance improvements.
- Shareable URLs (filters/state in query params).
- Auto-suggestions/typeahead in global and entity search.
- Tooltips, micro-interactions, and hover polish.
- Keyboard navigation and WCAG compliance.
- Regional settings (date/number/currency).
- i18n/localization framework + first locale.
- Expanded documentation (admin and user guides).
- Onboarding and guided tours.

## Phase 9: Mobile and PWA
- PWA install, icons, manifest, and offline shell.
- Mobile-optimized workflows for core CRUD.
- QR scanning for asset lookup.
- Offline mode support for read-only or limited write queues.

## Phase 10: Release Readiness
- Full test pass (unit, component, E2E).
- Manual regression of critical flows (login, CRUD, QR, reports).
- Migration and rollback plan finalized.
- Monitoring, logging, and error reporting checks.
- Final documentation update and release notes.

## Deliverables
- Feature-complete application matching `FEATURES.md`.
- Updated and verified database schema with migration history.
- Documentation covering setup, operations, and user workflows.
- QA checklist and release checklist with sign-off.

## Exit Criteria
- All `FEATURES.md` items implemented and verified.
- No P0/P1 bugs; acceptable P2 backlog.
- Tests and lint pass; monitoring in place.
