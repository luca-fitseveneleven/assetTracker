## Current State Summary (Codebase Observations)

### Implemented Capabilities
- Core CRUD for assets, accessories, licences, consumables, models, categories, manufacturers, suppliers, locations, and status types.
- Asset detail experience with QR generation, label printing, attachments, warranty tracking, depreciation summary, maintenance schedule list, lifecycle timeline, reservations, and transfers.
- User detail experience with history timeline and assignment management (assets, accessories, licences).
- Search and reporting: global search, per-entity filters, saved filters, reports dashboard, CSV/PDF export, and API docs UI.
- Inventory workflows: consumable min quantities, stock alerts, and check-out/usage tracking UI.
- Approvals workflow UI and API.
- Ticket system for admins and users, including kanban-style management.
- Admin settings UI for email providers, notifications, labels, custom fields, depreciation settings, orgs/departments/roles, webhooks, integrations, SSO/LDAP settings, and location tracking.
- Security baseline: NextAuth credential auth, JWT sessions, password hashing, rate limiting, account lockout, session timeout, audit logging, security headers, environment validation, feature flags, error pages, and health checks.
- Integrations baseline: webhook API + UI, Slack/Teams webhook settings, Freshdesk settings UI.
- QR scanner page with camera scanning and search fallback.

### Recently Completed (2026-02-18)
- Maintenance schedule management page (full CRUD, status badges, complete/delete actions).
- Warranty expiration dashboard in reports (summary cards, bar chart, sortable table).
- Custom fields admin UI in admin settings (full CRUD for field definitions).
- Consumable restock functionality (PATCH endpoint + Restock dialog on consumable detail).
- Password reset flow (forgot-password API with rate limiting, reset-password API, email template, UI pages, login link).
- Sidebar update with Maintenance link (Wrench icon in Tools section).
- Collapsible sidebar sections and scrollable nav.
- OfflineBanner SSR hydration fix.
- Next.js 16 middleware-to-proxy migration (`src/proxy.ts`).
- Merge conflict resolution (pagination + org-context + security features).
- **Phase 2**: Organization scoping enforced across 13+ API routes (search, tickets, approvals, maintenance, departments, user CRUD, asset CRUD). RBAC extended with `requirePermission()` guard on 30+ routes using 35 granular permissions.
- **Phase 3**: Workflow execution engine (`src/lib/workflow-engine.ts`) with condition evaluation, 5 action types, and scheduled checks. Cron endpoints for workflows and notifications (`/api/cron/workflows`, `/api/cron/notifications`). Webhook triggers added to 10+ API routes (asset, user, licence, consumable, maintenance CRUD).
- **Phase 4**: MFA/2FA support with TOTP (otplib), QR setup, backup codes, login flow integration, and MFA verify page. Concurrent session management with device tracking, IP logging, session list UI, revoke actions, and cron cleanup.
- **Phase 5**: Pagination standardized across 18 additional list endpoints (maintenance, reservations, tickets, approvals, suppliers, locations, manufacturers, models, webhooks, notifications, categories, orgs, departments, roles).
- **Phase 6**: PWA manifest, service worker (network-first + stale-while-revalidate), offline page, install prompt, and service worker registration.
- **Phase 7**: Marketing landing page with AppShell layout pattern, pricing page (3-tier), self-service registration with org creation, Stripe billing (checkout sessions, webhooks, customer portal), tenant resource limits (asset/user caps), terms of service, privacy policy.
- **Quick Wins Sprint**: Prettier + Husky pre-commit hooks, 56 database indexes across 24 models, Excel export (SheetJS), response compression, CSP security headers, 9 skeleton loading pages, shareable URLs (filter state in query params for all list pages), commitlint, AES-256-GCM encryption at rest for sensitive fields.

### Partially Implemented or Needs Completion
- SSO/LDAP/Freshdesk integrations (settings exist; auth/data flows not wired).
- Bulk import UI (API exists).
- Slack/Teams notification wiring to events.

## Open Tasks (Consolidated)

This list mirrors all unchecked tasks across plan files. Items fall into three categories:

1. **Implementation tasks** — Actual features to build (future roadmap)
2. **Verification/QA checklists** — Manual testing steps from SECURITY_AUTH_PLAN.md and IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md (require hands-on validation, not code changes)
3. **Operational/business tasks** — From SAAS_BUSINESS_GUIDE.md (marketing, hiring, ops processes — not code)

Most unchecked items are in categories 2 and 3. Core application features (Phases 1-7) are implemented and building.
